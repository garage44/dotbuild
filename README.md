Dotbuild is a simple opinionated buildtool for frontend development. 
It uses a simple async task structure and tries to keep things simple 
by keeping styles and assets separate from code.

It uses ESBuild for fast bundling and SASS as CSS preprocessor.

# Getting started

```
npm i -g @garage44/dotbuild
